# Mastering Data Visualization with Python


If love coding or would like to get immersed in the fantastic world of progamming, data analysis and visualization, then, this is the right place for you. Producing good data visualizations is a skill that will be always in high demand in all fields and disciplines. It is not only producing code, but also developing a deep understanding of the data and creating a story for the audience to understand.

## Seminar concept
Even though the use of AI is not forbidden, it won't be encouraged for the scope of this course. The idea of this seminar is that students develop the algorithmic and programming logic for creating data visualizations. Sure, AI (LLMs) can produce code very fast, but it can lead to long-term learning gaps. 

In this sense, the learning environment will mostly be like in the "pre Chatgpt" era.

## For whom is this seminar?
Very motivated students who want to expand/complement their data literacy and are willing to learn without taking shortcuts (like using vibe coding). No experience in programming or coding is needed. 

## Learning objective:
By the end of the seminar, the students will be confident in performing data visualizations with Python and creating a story out of it if any dataset is given. After the seminar, they will be able to apply what was learned in the course for their future courses, seminars, thesis and personal projects. 

The students will also be less dependant on AI tools when performing visualizations and understand more what AI is doing when they decide to use it to produce visualizations.
